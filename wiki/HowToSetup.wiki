export GAZEBO_PLUGINS_PATH=$HOME/iqr-gazebo/gazebo_files/plugins
}}}
or use the following commands to add them from the console line
{{{
echo 'export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$HOME/iqr-gazebo/gazebo_files/models' >> $HOME/.profile
echo 'export GAZEBO_PLUGINS_PATH=$HOME/iqr-gazebo/gazebo_files/plugins' >> $HOME/.profile
}}}

Please logout and login again to make sure the file is sourced. 

=== Build the iqr module ==

cd $HOME/iqr-gazebo/iqr_module
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

}}}

=== Build the gazebo plugins ==

In the second terminal:
{{{
cd $HOME/iqr-gazebo/iqr_files
