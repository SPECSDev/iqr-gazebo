#summary iqrBug features, sensors and actions.


= Introduction =

The iqrBug consists in a compilation of files including the  iqr module called moduleGazeboBug, the gazebo plugins and the gazebo model files. 


= Features=
The iqrBug offers a series of sensors and actuators. Here we describe their properties an proper use. 

==General==
The iqr module provides the communication between iqr and gazebo. All communication happens over groups of cells. An iqr system can comprise more than one iqrBug. To differentiate what iqrBug is controlled by what module use the *Bug name* parameter. To name needs to correspond to the name given to the bug in the gazebo world by default or in the  .world file. 

The modulGazeboBug iqr module is a threaded module. The *Cycles/Second* parameter determines the speed the module is running. This is independent on the speed iqr is running. Make sure that the three process i.e. iqr, gazebo, iqrModule have similar cycles per second. 

==Sensors==
===Laser Range Finder===
The laser range finder provides proximity information for almost the whole surrounding of the robot. The cells are from _left-back_ over _front_ to _right-back_.

===Laser Range Finder Gripper===
The laser range finder gripper provides proximity information for the near proximity of the gripper. The cells are from _left_ to _right_.

===Camera===
The camera provides different modes: RGB, BW, and HSV. Please tick the corresponding parameters in the module properties. No selection corresponds to the default RGB. 

The resolution of the camera is defined by the size of the groups. The default max resolution is 32x24. Please make sure all groups assigned to the different values of the camera have the same size. 

===GPS===
The GPS sensor offers position in x (cell 1) ,y (cell 2) and rotation (cell 3). This information is also transformed to place cell and head direction cell information. The resolution of both is defined by the geometry of the associated groups. The head direction cell group needs to be of height 1.  

Adjust the corresponding parameters to adjust the shape of the place and head direction cells.
